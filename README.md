pynn
====

pynn is a single layer neural network classifier for Python, with a similar usage to models in the
[Scikit-Learn](http://scikit-learn.org/stable/) library.

To install just download the `pynn.py` file or run
```
wget https://raw.github.com/benjamin-croker/pynn/master/pynn.py
```
You can also clone the entire repository by running
```
git clone https://github.com/benjamin-croker/pynn.git
```
The model uses a single hidden layer in a feed-forward network with sigmoid activation functions.
It can take sparse scipy matrices as inputs, as well as normal dense numpy arrays.

Example usage is given in `example.py`
